      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In New York, the forecast is pretty reliable. If the forecast says it's going to rain, it's most likely going to rain and its the same thing for when it's snowing or it's supposed to be sunny.
        </li>
        <li>
          The weather is different as the year goes aroung. In the summertime, it is blazing hot and in the winter, it is cold and snowing. In the fall, it gets windy along with the leaves changing colors and eventually falling off of trees. In the spring, it is usually raining and the leaves and flowers are starting to sprout and eventually bloom.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <span> Florida </span
        ><em> -Weather </em>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The forecast of Florida's weather is <b><i>NOT</i></b> reliable. Your weather app could tell you that it is sunny all day and then it randomly starts raining at 2 pm for ten minutes, stop and then start thunderstorming for the next three hours.
        </li>
        <li>
         In Florida, it is hot all year round. Florida natives say the coldest it gets in the winter time is 60° but the sun is still beaming so it doesn't feel as cool. The leaves off of the trees usually fall when their ready at any time of year.

      <ul>
        <li>
          In New York, depending on where you live there are different types of housing you could live in. The most common place to live in is an apartment or a condo, there are also townhouses, brownstones, and regular houses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since New York is such an iconic and important part of history along with being the "city that never sleeps", it costs more to live there than the average city.

      <ul>
        <li>
          In Florida, it is very common to find houses even for families who aren't in the high end of middle class. The only place you could find a couple of apartment complexs are in major ciries like in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm, Orlando, and Tampa.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Florida, somewhat housing in New York, living spaces are priced only by the amount of rooms, amenities (like a front yard or a pool), and the community.

          There is a variety of different cuisines and numerous different resturants to try from. You could choose to dine in, take out, or at a lot of restaurants you could decide to have your food directly delivered to your door. A lot of these restaurants are in walking distance which makes it easier to get to them.
        </li>
        <li>
         (I had to mke this it's own bullet point) The deli (corner store or whatever you want to call it) is a store that you could get yourself either breakfast, lunch, or dinner akong with a bev and your groceries. It's a pretty awesome place in my opinion.
        </li>
        <li>
        From Key Food to Whole Foods to Costco & BJ's, the supermarkets in New York have it all.

          Like New York, their are numerous different cuisines and resturants that you could try from. You also have all of the same options on how you choose to dine. The only difference is that these restaurants are more spaced out so they aren't as close to one another.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no delis. ☹️ There were delis but they are all either closed down or just abandoned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Like New York, supermarkets like Trader Joes, Publix, and Kroger have everything you need.

          There will always be something to do in one of the best cities on the planet. For people of all ages you could visit the different buildings, museums, parks, zoos and many other exciting and intriguing places. Did I mention that there are numerous shopping centers, movies, plays, and places where you could catch a boat to see the city from a whole different view? There is so much more to do but the only way to find out is to go and see for yourself.

          There are numerous ways to travel around New York. You could take the train or the bus for $2.75, a taxi, an uber/lyft or whatever car service you choose to use, or you could use your car or just rent one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since New York is relatively small, everything is in close proximity of each other so you could walk to your destination if you really wanted to.

      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The main way to travel in Florida is by car. If people don't own a car they either rent one or take a car service to get from place to place. Florida does have buses but they aren't convienent because they come every 20 or 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since Florida is a very big place, everything is spaced out so unless you like walks that would take you thirty minutes to get somewhere when it could only take you 5 minutes to drive there, that option of transportation isn't suggested.
        </li>
