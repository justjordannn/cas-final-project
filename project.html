      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In New York, the forecast is pretty reliable. If the forecast says it's going to rain, it's most likely going to rain and its the same thing for when it's snowing or it's supposed to snow.
        </li>
        <li>
          The weather is different as the year goes aroung. In the summertime, it is blazing hot and in the winter, it is cold and snowing. In the fall, it gets windy along with the leaves changing colors and eventually falling off of trees. In the spring, it is usually raining and the leaves and flowers are starting to sprout and eventually bloom.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <span> Florida </span
        ><em> -Weather </em>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The forecast of Florida's weather is <b><i>NOT</i></b> reliable. Your weather app could tell you that it is sunny all day and then it randomly starts raining at 2 pm for ten minutes, stop and then start thunderstorming for the next three hours.
        </li>
        <li>
         In Florida, it is hot all year round. Florida natives say the coldest it gets in the winter time is 60Â° but the sun is still beaming so it doesn't feel as cool. The leaves off of the trees usually fall when their ready at any time of year.

      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In New York, depending on where you live there are different types of housing you could live in. The most common place to live in is an apartment or a condo, there are also townhouses, brownstones, and regular houses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since New York is such an iconic and important part of history along with being the "city that never sleeps", it costs more to live there than the average city.

      <ul>
        <li>
          In Florida, it is very common to find houses even for families who aren't in the high end of middle class. The only place you could find a couple of apartment complexs are in major ciries like in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm, Orlando, and Tampa.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Florida, unlike housing in New York, living spaces are priced only by the amount of rooms, amenities (like a front yard or a pool), and the community.
